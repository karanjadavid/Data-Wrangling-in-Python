    "# We Rate Dogs Data wrangling Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling process.\n",
    "1. Data Gathering.\n",
    "2. Data Assessing.\n",
    "3. Data Cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.0 Data Gathering\n",
    "The 'We Rate Dogs' projects had three data sources. \n",
    "1. twitter_archive_enhanced.csv is a file which I downloaded manually and stored in my working directory.\n",
    "2. image_predictions is the second file which i downloaded from Udacity servers using the requests library.\n",
    "3. For the JSON data, I downloaded by querying the Twitter API using the Tweepy library. I extracted favourite_count and retweet_count  programmatically from the tweet_json.txt file. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.0 Assessment\n",
    "I used both visual and programmatic methods of assessment. \n",
    "For Visual assessment, I opened the files in other softwares like Excel and scrolled through the numerous rows noting data inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For programmatic assessment, I used my jupyter notebook to assess data quality and data tidiness issues. For data quality, I was looking foe completeness, validity, accuracy and consistency of the three dataframes. For data tidiness, I was looking for structural issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Assessment findings\n",
    "#### 2.1.1. Quality\n",
    "##### archive\n",
    "I assessed archive, predictions and tweet_stats data systematically. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project required the use of original tweets only. The first assement task was to find out whether the archive dataframe contained retweets and reply tweets. I found that archive contained 181 retweets andd 78 reply tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rating_numerator columns had values that were too large that were either inaccurately typed or were extreme outliers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rating_denominator had outliers and values that weren't the base 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expanded urls column had some missing data. I however ignored the missing data because they were very few and wouldn't affect the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamp column had an erroneous datatype. It was object/string instead of datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source column had ambigous text: a html tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### predictions\n",
    "The jpg_url column had 66 duplicate images.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### tweet_stats\n",
    "The date_created column has an erroneous datatype. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Tidiness\n",
    "##### archive\n",
    "The assessment revealed that there were four columns doggo, puppo, pupper, floffer  which are all dog stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### prediction\n",
    "p1,p2,p3 are columns containing the same data: (breed) this will be determined by the highest p_conf among p1_conf, p2_conf, and p3_conf. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other unnecessary columns that won't assist in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.0 Cleaning\n",
    "Before cleaning, I made copies of my data. I named the dataframes: archive_clean, predictions_clean and tweet_stats_clean respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### archive_clean\n",
    "I began cleaning archive_clean. I dropped 181 tweets that were retweets  and the 78 that were replies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I no longer had retweets and replies in my dataframe, I dropped 'retweeted_status_id', 'retweeted_status_user_id', 'retweeted_status_timestamp', 'in_reply_to_status_id', and 'in_reply_to_user_id'columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "I converted timestamp's datatype from string to datetime using pd.to_datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then extracted the device used to tweet from the source column using regualar expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "I melted the four dog stages: doggo, floofer, pupper, puppo into one column which I named dogs_stage. In addition, I sorted dogs_stage in order to then drop duplicated based on tweet_id except for the last occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "I filtered rating_numerator column to have only ratings < 20\n",
    "\n",
    "I filtered rating_deniominator to only have a denominator == 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the rating_denominator column only contained a 10 rating, It was no longer useful. I therefore dropped it. \n",
    "\n",
    "I renamed the rating_numerator column to rating\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### predictions_clean\n",
    "I created two new columns, breed and confidence. breed was determined on condition of having the max p_conf.\n",
    "Confidence column contains the max conf. \n",
    "\n",
    "I dropped the duplicate jpg_url images then dropped columns that were no longer useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### tweet_stats_clean\n",
    "I changed the date_created datatype from string to date time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I merged the three cleaned dataframes on tweet_id and saved as a csv named twitter_archive_data. \n"
